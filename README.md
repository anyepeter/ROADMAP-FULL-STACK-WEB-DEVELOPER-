# ROADMAP-FULL-STACK-WEB-DEVELOPER-
A plan for my journey toward full stack development. So that you can follow along, I will summarize each day's lessons for you.
## DAY one(researching)
### full stack web developer:
It someone who write code for both the frontend that is the client side and the backend that is the server side. Client-side devices, such as a laptop, smartphone, or other device, are used to view websites.
-  These days, full stack developers have some of the highest paying professions, and you can become one without a degree.
- Not just coding will help you get a job but networking yourself into it and the way you apply for job.
### Why most dont become full stack developer
"Trough of sorrow" its a curve which show how peoples get frustrated in learning how to code and it also show why people remain in one spot without changing.
#### Reanson why people stay in one spot.
- Sent money buying many courses which they dont even start it. this is because they believe spending money in buying courses means you are progressing.
- Not having a community to help them when they are stock.
#### Overcoming TROUGH  OF SORROW
- Managing frustration by looking for a community to help you. I found [100Devs](https://100devsfollowalong.netlify.app/) its a good community.
- Consistency: Putin at least 2hours daily for coding.
- Take care of yourself

### NETWORK YOURSELF
- connect with 3 individuals already in tech weekly using socail media.
- 2 coffee chats weekly with them.

### LEARN HOW TO LEARN
