# ROADMAP-FULL-STACK-WEB-DEVELOPER-
A plan for my journey toward full stack development. So that you can follow along, I will summarize each day's lessons for you.
## DAY one(researching)
### full stack web developer:
It someone who write code for both the frontend that is the client side and the backend that is the server side. Client-side devices, such as a laptop, smartphone, or other device, are used to view websites.
-  These days, full stack developers have some of the highest paying professions, and you can become one without a degree.
- Not just coding will help you get a job but networking yourself into it and the way you apply for job.
### Why most dont become full stack developer
"Trough of sorrow" its a curve which show how peoples get frustrated in learning how to code and it also show why people remain in one spot without changing.
#### Reanson why people stay in one spot.
- Sent money buying many courses which they dont even start it. this is because they believe spending money in buying courses means you are progressing.
- Not having a community to help them when they are stock.
#### Overcoming TROUGH  OF SORROW
- Managing frustration by looking for a community to help you. I found [100Devs](https://100devsfollowalong.netlify.app/) its a good community.
- Consistency: Putin at least 2hours daily for coding.
- Take care of yourself.

### NETWORK YOURSELF
- connect with 3 individuals already in tech weekly using socail media.
- 2 coffee chats weekly with them.

### LEARN HOW TO LEARN 
- Practise  active recall. you can watch this [video](https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE)
- Space repetition. You can watch this [video](https://youtu.be/Z-zNHHpXoMM)

These are the things I learned the first day.

# Day two(plan)

## Make a plan

 You can become a full-stack developer consistently if you have a plan in place. I need to schedule my week so that I may accomplish my objective of becoming a full stack developer within the next 30 weeks. Planning out your day will help you be consistent because you won't just leap into it. So, starting this weekend, make plans for your week and for each day of the week so that you may accomplish your goals for the week.
 
 ## Golden rule
 
  ### speration of concerns
  
  Separating your code's elements or tags using comments or blank spaces can make it easier for you and others to read. This is known as separation of concerns.
In order to make a website that is easy to read, we also divide the various languages into their own pages.
  
  ## Languages
  
  **HTML** use to create the content of a page. 
  
  **CSS** use to design the page.
  
  **JAVASCRIPT** use for the interaction of a page.
  
  HTML and CSS are not actually regarded as programming languages because they cannot respond to operations that are given to them. for instance, if you type 3 + 2 in HTML or CSS, you won't get 5. So markup languages refer to both HTML and CSS. They have a syntax that you must adhere to, which is why they are referred to as languages.
Javascript will be the sole programming language I learn, and I'll utilize it on both the client and server sides of my applications.
   ## START
   
 I recently started learning HTML, and today I learned the 15 most crucial tags.
 
  ### Heading Elements (tags)
  
\<h1> MOST IMPORTANT \</h1>

\<h2> .............. \</h2>

\<h3> .............. \</h3>

\<h4> .............. \</h4>

\<h5> .............. \</h5>

\<h6> .............. \</h6>

  ### Other Text Elements
\<p> Paragraph \</p>

\<span> Short text\ </span>

  
  ### Nerd Fights
\<br>

\<hr>

### Elements
\<em> Stress Emphasis \</em>

\<strong> Strong Importance \</strong>

### Ordered List
\<ol>

 \<li> Item 1 \</li>
 
  \<li> Item 2 \</li>
  
\</ol>

### Unordered List
\<ul>

  \<li> Item 1 \</li>
  
  \<li> Item 2 \</li>
  
\</ul>

### Containing Elements

\<div> \</div>

\<section> \</section>

\<article> \</article>

\<aside> \</aside>

\<header> \</header>

\<footer> \</footer>

### Image

You can check my github to see how I use the tags on the folder [DAY TWO](https://github.com/anyepeter/ROADMAP-FULL-STACK-WEB-DEVELOPER-/blob/main/DAY%20TWO/index.html)

# DAY 3

## HTML structure 
  I learned the html structure today that is 
 
 \<!DOCTYPE html>
 
\<html>

  \<head>
  
   \<!-- Stuff the browser needs \-->
   
  \</head>
  
  \<body>
  
    \<!-- Everything the user sees \-->
    
    \<h1>Hello, Twitch! \</h1>
    
  \</body>
  
\</html>

 The \<!DOCTPYE html> tell the brower the type of html its dealing with. other DOCTYPE were very long so this means the html5 DOCTYPE is the recent one.
 The \<html></html> is the root tag that means all what you write in a html document is in the root tag. Any tag inside the html tag is a child e.g head and body.
 the \<head></head> is everything the brower need to daplay the page.
 the \<body></body> are the things we can see. 
 The human being is one such instance. Being a human is similar to using HTML; the body of a person displays what we can see, while the head obscures our ability to understand what the person is thinking.
 
 ## New tags 
  \<nav></nav>
  
  The navigation tag outlines the types of activities that may be done on your website or how a user can move around it.
  ## Info from users
  \<form action="confirmation.html" method="post">
  
  \<!-- Data collection elements go here -->
  
\</form>
We use the form tag to collect info from user. We use input types like:
- Text
- Password
- Tel
- Email
- Button
